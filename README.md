Arvind, Under the Engineering Services tabs, can you move Engineering Design to the first position (before DMSMS/Obsolescence Support)?
Also, can you add Vendor's web page to the new website and add a link called "Vendors" next to "Contact Us" at the bottom of webpages? The old vendor's page is at: http://teledevices.com/TeleDevices%20Terms%20and%20Conditions%20for%20Commercial%20Orders.pdf
We need to find either C-130, F-15/F-16, C-5, C-17 or A-10 aircrafts which are used by Robins AFB on our home page. If we can get a C-130 dispensing flares that will be great.
Initially, can you just add our existing TeleDevices logo from the old website?
Our website is looking good. I also like the clarity and layout of http://atscva.com/Products.aspx If you see any idea we can utilize from atscva website that will be ok.
