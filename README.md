Arvind, Under the Engineering Services tabs, can you move Engineering Design to the first position (before DMSMS/Obsolescence Support)?

Also, can you add Vendor's web page to the new website and add a link called "Vendors" next to "Contact Us" at the bottom of webpages? The old vendor's page is at: http://teledevices.com/TeleDevices%20Terms%20and%20Conditions%20for%20Commercial%20Orders.pdf

We need to find either C-130, F-15/F-16, C-5, C-17 or A-10 aircrafts which are used by Robins AFB on our home page. If we can get a C-130 dispensing flares that will be great.
It will be ideal to add video similar to the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGa9vtkTvX4

C-17 Landing video from Adobe can work initially. I have saved a small size video of C-17 landing under assets. Can we keep running that video repeatedly as long as home page is active?

Initially, can you just add our existing TeleDevices logo from the old website?

Our website is looking good. I also like the clarity and layout of http://atscva.com/Products.aspx If you see any idea we can utilize from atscva website that will be ok.

We are almost done. Let's buy all the images we need from Adobe. Please get the new credit card number from me since the old card is replaced fraud alert. 

Let's launch the website by the end of this month.
