                       TeleDevices, LLC (TDL) engineers designed, tested and manufactured the C-130H aircraft’s Advanced Lighting Control System (ALCS) to provide form, fit and functional replacement
                       for the legacy ALCS which encountered serious parts obsolescence issues as well as lack of Technical Data Package (TDP). 
                        
                       C-130H ALCS is an airborne system used by the USAF, and TDL performed all engineering tasks in-house at our facility in Duluth, GA.
                       TDL’s design of the new ALCS involved diverse engineering capabilities such as software/firmware development, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design, 
                       VHDL, DC- DC converters, micro-controllers, PCB design, mechanical engineering, production et cetera. 
                       Modernized C-130H ALCS was fully tested in the TDL’s lab to verify the functionality according to ATP, it was then installed on a C130H aircraft at Peterson AFB.
                       TDL undertook redesign, fabrication of ALCS units, performed training, debugging/repairs, ATP/ATR development, Automatic Test System development, and TDP development—which included 
                       delivery of Engineering Drawings in accordance with the USAF drawing requirements.

                        The AN/ALE-47(V) Countermeasures Dispenser System (CMDS) is an integrated, threat-adaptive, reprogrammable, computer-controlled airborne
                        defensive system. The AN/ALE-47 dispenses countermeasure decoys (Chaff, Flare and others) against radar and infrared homing threats to
                        enhance aircraft survivability.
                        TDL initially performed failure trend and failure mode analyses on ALE-47  to identify not only the types of failures occurring most often in the field,
                        but also to identify the root causes of these anomalies. TDL then redesigned ALE-47 CCAs and performed first article development, qualification testing , and TDP development. 
                        TDL designed, fabricated, assembled, tested and qualified ALE-47 Programmer Power Supply CCA, Sequencer Fire Source CCA, and CDU Power Supply Connector Interface CCAs.
                        TDL has received exceptional CPAR from the US Air Force for the quality of the work performed in every facet of the program.
                        Currently, TDL JV team is awarded 7.5 years ALE-47 Production Contract which also includes development of Automatic Test System to test every ALE-47 SRU and LRU.

                        TeleDevices, LLC, under terms of the contract awarded by the US Air Force, was tasked to design, build and become qualified manufacturer of Low Voltage
                        Power Supply (LVPS) used on the AN/ALQ-184 Electronic Attack (EA) Pod, which provides primary self-defense against enemy radar-guided 
                        air defense systems for the A-10 and F-16 aircrafts.  This switch-mode, high-efficiency power supply provided +5.2VDC, +64VDC, and +15/ 15 VDC outputs IAW the specifications 
                        provided. TDL was tasked to design, reverse engineer, and build functional, flight - worthy prototypes, perform 
                        integration and testing to meet the same form, fit, and functional compatibility with the original unit. 
                        TDL engineers used a modular approach to design the high efficiency LVPS where use of a backplane eliminated all the wiring. Planar transformers 
                        were implemented to improve reliability and manufacturability. Modular design of this switched mode power supply also made manufacturing 
                        as well as repairs and maintenance easier. Modular design with backplane resulted in improved reliability, maintainability, and testability.

                        TDL has designed TeleSampler, an Automatic Stormwater Sampler with built-in remote
                        communication. This product has taken the hassle out of NPDES stormwater monitoring!
                        TeleSampler not only monitors the rainfall, grabs samples but also reports the data
                        directly to your office!
                        <br/><br/>
                        TeleSampler can be easily programmed on-site using a hand held terminal or a laptop.
                        You can set the rainfall level at which the sample is taken. Using a laptop, you can also
                        program in the TeleSampler the telephone number of your office where the data should be
                        reported. In the test mode, you can test the pump, battery voltage, level sensor and communication
                        capability of your TeleSampler.
